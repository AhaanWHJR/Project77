    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Visual Studio</h1>
    Visual Studio is a powerful and versatile integrated development environment (IDE) that supports multiple
    programming languages, platforms, and technologies. You can use Visual Studio to create applications for desktop,
    web, mobile, games, and more. You can also use Visual Studio to debug, test, and deploy your code.

    To set up Visual Studio on Windows 10, you need to download and install the appropriate edition and version from the
    Visual Studio website. You can choose from Community, Professional, or Enterprise editions, depending on your needs
    and preferences. You can also select the features and workloads that you want to install, such as .NET, C++, Python,
    Unity, etc. You can customize your installation by adding or removing individual components, language packs, and
    installation locations. After the installation is complete, you can start developing your projects in Visual Studio.
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Console screen</h1>
    A console screen of JavaScript is a display that shows the output of JavaScript code that is executed in the
    browser. You can use the console screen to test, debug, or experiment with JavaScript code, as well as to view
    messages, errors, or warnings from the browser or the web page.

    To open the console screen of JavaScript in Microsoft Edge, you can use one of the following methods:

    <ul>
        <li>Press Ctrl + Shift + J on Windows or Cmd + Option + J on Mac to directly open the developer tools console.</li>
        <li>Right-click on the web page and select Inspect. This will open the developer tools. Then, click on the Console tab
            to switch to the console screen.</li>
    </ul>
    To print anything on the console screen of JavaScript, you can use the console.log() method, which takes any value
    as an argument and displays it on the console.

        var a = 5
        var b = 4
        var sum = a + b
        console.log(sum)
